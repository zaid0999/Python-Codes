Mapping
Python support only one mapping type called “dictionary” or dict class
Dictionary is a mapping collection or data type.
In dictionary data is organized as key and value pair.
Key and value is called item of dictionary.
Dictionary is collection of items, each time consist of two values
1. Key
2. Value
A key mapped with one or more than one value.
Duplicate keys are not allowed but duplicate values are allowed.
Keys are immutable (OR) only immutable objects are used as key.
Value can be mutable or immutable.
Dictionary is mutable collection, after creating dictionary changes can be done.

In application development dictionary is used to group individual objects where data is organized in key and value pair.


2. Creating dictionary with items. Each item consists of key and value.
This key and value is separated with : and each item is separated
comma
Syntax: {key:value,key:value,key:value,….}
