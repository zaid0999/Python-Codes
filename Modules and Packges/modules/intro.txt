Every python program technicaly is caled one module. 
An application is not one module or program, it is colection of modules or programs. 
Modular programming alows dividing the content of application into number of programs, so that maintaining the code becomes easy and it also alows reusability between programs.

Types of modules 
Modules are 2 types 
    1. Predefined modules 
    2. User defined modules 

Predefined modules 
Existing modules are caled predefined modules (OR) modules provided by python or third party vendors are caled predefined modules. 
Example: sys, os, datatime, calendar,… 
Existing modules are also caled libraries 

User defined modules 
The modules developed by programmer are caled user defined modules. These are application specific modules

Syntax1: import module-name 
Syntax2: import module-name as alias-name 
Syntax3: from <module-name> import * 
Syntax4: from <module-name> import identifier, identifier,…
