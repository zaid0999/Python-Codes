global keyword 

The global statement is a declaration which holds for the entire current code block. It means that the listed identifiers are to be interpreted as globals. It would be impossible to assign to a global variable without global, although free variables may refer to globals without being declared global. 

Names listed in a global statement must not be used in the same code block textualy preceding that global statement. 

Syntax: global variable,variable,variable,â€¦
