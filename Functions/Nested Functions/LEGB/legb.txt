LEGB 
 
The LEGB rule in Python dictates the order in which the interpreter searches for variable names: Local, Enclosing, Global, Built-in.  
 
LEGB stands 
L  Local 
E Enclosed  
G Global 
B Builtins 

Local: 
Python first checks if the variable is defined within the current  function or code block. 

Enclosing: 
If not found localy, it then looks in the scope of any enclosing functions (nested functions). 

Global:
If the variable isn't in the local or enclosing scope, it checks the global scope (variables defined at the top level of the script). 

Built-in: 
Fina ly, if the variable is not found in any of the above scopes, Python searches for it in the built-in scope (Python's pre-defined functions and objects).
